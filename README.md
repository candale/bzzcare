Beehive heating and other bee services with Moteino (LoRa)

RPI/LoRa/Arduino stack for controlling and logging temperature inside a beehive over the winter.
Additional sensors will be added in the future.

The aim of the project is to be able to monitor the state of a beehive (temperature, humidity, noise etc)
and take appropriate action either automatically (raise beehive temperature) or manually (the hive is about
to split in two).
